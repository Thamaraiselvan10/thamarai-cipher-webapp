## ‚ú® About The Project

**Thamarai's Cipher** is not just another Caesar cipher. It's a unique **Substitution Cipher** built with a custom, shuffled alphabet, making your secret messages even more secure.

This project was born from a simple Python script and transformed into a fully interactive web experience with a focus on a clean user interface, cool animations, and a mobile-first responsive design.

Here's what makes it special:
*   **Unique Encryption:** Uses a secret, pre-defined shuffled alphabet (`qwertzuiop...`) instead of the standard ABCs, so a simple shift won't crack it!
*   **Dynamic UI:** The interface is alive with a gradient title, glowing buttons, and a result that appears with a fun typing animation.
*   **Fully Responsive:** Designed to look and work beautifully on any device, from a large desktop monitor to your mobile phone.
*   **Built with Vanilla JS:** No frameworks, just pure, lightweight HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
